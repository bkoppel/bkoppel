# Early Childhood lol

I spent my childhood in Cuba, at five my parents divorced and my dad moved back to Swizterland. When I was 13 I left Cuba on my own, and moved with my grandparents on my mom side in Mexico. I attended a private school where I learned C and programming for the next 4 years. Two weeks before my 18th birthday I moved to the United States in the Winter of 2014. Living in America has always been in my list of "Places I would be happy no matter what, because where I grew up is definetly been the worst of all places on Earth", which also defines who I am as a person. While in the beginning it was a source of "hustle" energy, your "grind to the top and don't stop" energy that makes you chunk hours of study into many nights. Still There's a lot left for me to learn.

## Video games

Growing up in Cuba I had a Pentium Computer. When my brother left cuba, he left the computer and I took care of it. I got a Gameboy Emulator where I played "Fire Emblem", "Advanced Wars", "Metroid", "Zelda", among other titles. Eventually I got a Nintendo 64 emulator from a friend, but found out that I needed a stronger Graphics Card because the game rendered at close to single digits fps.

When I got to Mexico, my grandparents gifted me my first ever laptop, It was an HP Compaq 6510b, I ran so much WoW on it and all kinds of games, thank you ATI Radeon for not giving up on me at single digits fps. This period I played lots of WoW and I had just discovered my addiction for Video Games was real, and it became one of the first obstacles I had to overcome on my own as a teenage.

When I got to the US, the pool of games just increased and nowadays there's so much to play, "Factorio" will always have a place in my heart.

## Music

When I moved to Mexico, I discovered the Internet and with it, I discovered that you could download Software that plays music that you wrote, and that there was a language called MIDI to send sequenced note instructions and bang, I had just discovered the Digital Audio Workstation at 14 and I was hooked for the next 10 years, and I guess wanting to become a musician lead me into playing electric guitar and bass at a local Boston band called "Throw" for a Highschool friend of mine. Eventually music started taking a toll on my Software career around 2023 and I decided to split roads with the band and my public music making endevours, as I still play my own music in the warm comfort of my private space and close friends. 

My taste has changed through my life. Some of my nonstop listens are : Massive Attack, any good urban Hardcore(Metal genre) songs, Intense Warehouse Techno, Smooth Pink floy or Indie Shoegaze.
