### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Name is Bruno KÃ¶ppel (RodrÃ­guez)

- âš¡ Fun Fact: I wrote my first program when I was 14 years old. It was afterschool, in the computer lab of my middle school back in Cuba, when I wrote my first hello world program in C, using the Dev-C++ IDE. Another fun fact is that they were running ubuntu distros in there instead of the usual windows os that other labs had.

- ðŸ”­ I am a Programmer, sometimes a tinkerer. Currently working on a whole lot of projects which you can see in more detail at my [website](http://brunokoppel.com), always looking for cool things to build and explore.

- ðŸŽ› I make electronic music -> [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6BdSmIpqVam6MashlNUOoK?si=f8mVigR-TQaATPULzTWL-w) 

- ðŸ‘¯ Need a application tester, a C/C++ specialist, maybe just a buddy for your open source? Well, I'm open to help and collaborate!

- ðŸ“« You can reach me out at my email in this github page, at twitter, LinkedIn.

#### Experience
- 3 years of C/C++
- 2 years of Full Stack Experience (React, Django, Express, GraphQL, Gatsby, Typescript and Javascript)
- 2 years of Python
- 1 year of Java
